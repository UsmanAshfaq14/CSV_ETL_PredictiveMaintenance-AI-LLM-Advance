# CSV_ETL_PredictiveMaintenance-AI Case Study

## Overview

**CSV_ETL_PredictiveMaintenance-AI** is a specialized system designed to extract, transform, and load CSV data to enhance predictive maintenance in manufacturing systems. The system’s primary objective is to parse machine data provided in CSV format, validate it against strict rules, perform explicit, step-by-step calculations, and then provide a final recommendation regarding the maintenance needs of the machines. Every step—from data validation to detailed computations—is explained clearly using visual formulas so that even non-technical users can follow the process.

## Metadata

- **Project Name:** CSV_ETL_PredictiveMaintenance-AI  
- **Version:** 1.0.0  
- **Author:** Usman Ashfaq  
- **Keywords:** Predictive Maintenance, Data Validation, CSV ETL, Manufacturing, Maintenance Optimization, Step-by-Step Calculations

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system checks the input CSV data to ensure that:
  - **Format:** The data is provided in CSV format.
  - **Required Fields:** Every machine record must include:
    - `machine_id`
    - `runtime_hours`
    - `vibration_level`
    - `temperature`
    - `maintenance_threshold`
    - `max_operating_hours`
    - `scaling_factor`
  - **Data Integrity:** The system validates that numeric values are positive (where applicable), that `temperature` falls between 0 and 200, and that `maintenance_threshold` is between 0 and 100. When errors are detected (such as missing fields or out-of-range values), a comprehensive Data Validation Report is generated, which specifies the exact error and the row in which it occurs.

- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**  
  Once the data is validated, the system transforms the input by performing a series of explicit calculations for each machine record:
  - **Predicted Failure Risk Calculation:**  
    $$ \text{Predicted Failure Risk} = \text{vibration\_level} \times \text{scaling\_factor} $$
    *Multiply vibration level by scaling factor.*
  - **Maintenance Urgency Ratio Calculation:**  
    $$ \text{Maintenance Urgency Ratio} = \frac{\text{Predicted Failure Risk}}{\text{runtime\_hours}} \times 100 $$
    *Divide the Predicted Failure Risk by runtime hours, then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage.*
  - **Operating Margin Calculation:**  
    $$ \text{Operating Margin} = \frac{(\text{max\_operating\_hours} - \text{runtime\_hours})}{\text{max\_operating\_hours}} \times 100 $$
    *Subtract runtime hours from maximum operating hours, divide by maximum operating hours, and multiply by 100.*
  - **Composite Maintenance Score Calculation:**  
    $$ \text{Composite Score} = (\text{Operating Margin} \times 0.3) + ((100 - \text{Maintenance Urgency Ratio}) \times 0.7) $$
    *Multiply Operating Margin by 0.3; subtract Maintenance Urgency Ratio from 100, multiply by 0.7; then add the two results.*
  - **Efficiency Ratio Calculation:**  
    $$ \text{Efficiency Ratio} = \frac{\text{runtime\_hours}}{\text{Predicted Failure Risk}} $$
    *Divide runtime hours by Predicted Failure Risk.*

- **Final Recommendation:**  
  The system uses defined thresholds to determine the final recommendation:
  - **Thresholds:**  
    - The Efficiency Ratio is considered optimal if it lies between 0.90 and 9.90.
    - If the Composite Score is at least 75, the Efficiency Ratio is within the optimal range, and the Maintenance Urgency Ratio is less than or equal to the maintenance_threshold value, then the machine is considered optimal and requires no immediate maintenance.
    - Otherwise, the system recommends scheduling maintenance promptly.
  
- **User Interaction and Feedback:**  
  The system interacts with users by:
  - Greeting and offering CSV data input templates.
  - Providing detailed error messages and a Data Validation Report when input data is missing fields or contains invalid values.
  - Requesting confirmation before proceeding with the analysis.
  - Generating a comprehensive final report that includes all calculation steps and a clear recommendation.

GENERAL SYSTEM GUIDELINES

Always validate the input data first; DO NOT proceed with any calculations if validations fail. Show every calculation step clearly with explicit formulas and intermediate steps. Use IF/THEN/ELSE logic precisely as defined above. Round all numerical values to 2 decimal places. If the user provides any remarks after the final calculation, respond with "Thank you for your remarks. I'll surely look into it." Provide clear feedback and a rating mechanism if applicable. Remember to use precise IF/THEN/ELSE logic, provide detailed and step-by-step calculations, and structure your final response in markdown format as specified.

## Variations and Test Flows

### Flow 1: Greeting with Data and Missing Field  
- **User Action:**  
  The user greets with "Hello" and provides CSV data containing more than 5 rows. However, one machine record is missing a required field (e.g., `temperature` is missing in row 3).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system detects the missing field and returns a Data Validation Report that includes:
  ```markdown
  # Data Validation Report
  ## Data Structure Check:
  - Number of machines: 5
  - Number of fields per record: 7
  
  ## Required Fields Check:
  - machine_id: present
  - runtime_hours: valid
  - vibration_level: valid
  - temperature: missing in row 3
  - maintenance_threshold: valid
  - max_operating_hours: valid
  - scaling_factor: valid
  
  ## Validation Summary:
  ERROR: Missing required field(s): temperature in row 3. Please correct and resubmit.
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  The user is informed of the missing field and asked to correct and resubmit the data.

### Flow 2: Correct Data Submission and Validation  
- **User Action:**  
  The user corrects the CSV data (now including all required fields) and submits at least 10 rows, with most machines expected to be optimal.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates the data and returns a successful Data Validation Report:
  ```markdown
  # Data Validation Report
  ## Data Structure Check:
  - Number of machines: 10
  - Number of fields per record: 7
  
  ## Required Fields Check:
  - machine_id: present
  - runtime_hours: valid
  - vibration_level: valid
  - temperature: valid
  - maintenance_threshold: valid
  - max_operating_hours: valid
  - scaling_factor: valid
  
  ## Validation Summary:
  Data validation is successful! Would you like to proceed with analysis or provide another dataset?
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  The user confirms, and the system proceeds with detailed analysis.

### Flow 3: Detailed Analysis and Final Report Generation  
- **User Action:**  
  The user agrees to proceed with analysis.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system processes the data and outputs a final report in markdown format. The report includes detailed step-by-step calculations for each machine and a final recommendation. For example, machines with a Composite Score ≥ 75, Efficiency Ratio between 0.90 and 9.90, and Maintenance Urgency Ratio within the threshold are classified as "Optimal" and receive the recommendation "No immediate maintenance required." Other machines that do not meet these criteria are flagged as requiring maintenance.

## Conclusion

**CSV_ETL_PredictiveMaintenance-AI** is a powerful, user-friendly tool that automates the extraction, transformation, and validation of CSV data for predictive maintenance in manufacturing systems. By enforcing rigorous data validation rules and providing transparent, step-by-step calculations, the system ensures that maintenance recommendations are both accurate and easy to understand. The case study demonstrates the system's capability to handle various data scenarios—from error detection to final reporting—making it an invaluable asset for optimizing machine performance and reducing unexpected downtime in manufacturing environments.
